## Description

In this project I used the php Laravel framework.

My project provides the basic concept of Outdoor advertising and you can find out the services and types of outdoor advertising on my website

I created a project so that it would be convenient for customers to get acquainted with the types of outdoor advertising and leave a request for advice and the opportunity to get an answer to their question.

## Features
As I said earlier my project has a form for leaving a message, when you submit your question you can attach a picture
